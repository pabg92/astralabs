Context:
- We now store clause approvals and risk acceptance in Supabase (`clause_reviews`), but the current implementation hardcodes reviewer_id="system" and ignores tenant/user auth, so any user can write reviews for any clause.
- We also added clause info drawers and pdf highlights, but may need to reference future RAG improvements.

Tasks for Claude:
1. Update supabase/migrations/012_add_risk_accepted_to_clause_reviews.sql to include reviewer_id (UUID) and tenant_id columns plus comments, and add basic foreign keys or notes for RLS.
2. Update app/api/reconciliation/[dealId]/clauses/[clauseBoundaryId]/route.ts so PATCH/GET enforce authentication with createServerClient(), check the user's tenant matches the deal, and store reviewer_id + tenant_id. Ensure only authorized users (same tenant) can upsert clause reviews. Remove the hardcoded "system" reviewer.
3. Add tenant-aware fetching in app/api/reconciliation/[dealId]/route.ts – include clause_reviews joined with clause_boundaries so the UI receives persisted decisions (and risk flags) keyed by boundary IDs.
4. Update app/reconciliation/page.tsx to consume persisted clause_reviews, set clauseBoundaryId on each Clause, and send real user decisions via the new API. Ensure state updates after API success, and handle loading/failure gracefully.
5. Refresh pdf-rag.md to mention the new persistence + highlight context, and update plan.md with the persisted approval feature plus future improvements (PDF highlight v2, clause insights). If necessary, mention Next 15 param-await fix.
6. Testing: describe manual steps (approve clause, refresh, cross-tenant attempt to ensure denial, pdf highlight check) and any notes.

Deliverables:
- Modified migration (012) with reviewer_id/tenant_id.
- Updated API route (PATCH/GET) with auth + tenant checks.
- Updated /api/reconciliation/[dealId] route to return clause_reviews.
- UI adjustments to use clauseBoundaryId and call the API for approval.
- Documentation updates (pdf-rag.md, plan.md) summarizing persistence & PDF highlight future.
- Testing notes.
